		<blockquote>
		<p> Hello!<br /> Thank you for taking the time to review what will in time become a far more impressive 
			website. As indicated on the home page, this is my portfolio. I have provided visitors 
			access to the About page (the page you are currently on), a Contact page, and a link to an online art and design portfolio
			of mine that I have allowed to lapse and no longer maintain. <br /> Enjoy! <br /> -Danone
